## 🧩 Vercel v0 Usage (Short Notes)

- I used **Vercel v0** to generate a reusable UI badge component.  
- The v0 component was integrated into the landing page as part of the UI.  
- v0 helped speed up the design process by providing ready-to-use component structure.  
- The rest of the layout and styling was refined and organized inside Next.js for clarity and maintainability.  
- This confirms the required usage of v0 for UI generation.
